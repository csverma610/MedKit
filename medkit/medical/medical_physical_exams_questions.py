"""medical_physical_exams_questions - Generate structured physical examination questions.

This module generates comprehensive, clinically-relevant questions for different types of
physical examinations. It creates questions across multiple examination techniques
(inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation) and includes assessment questions for
medical history, lifestyle, and family history.

Age and gender are now essential parameters to ensure questions are appropriate and
relevant to the specific patient profile.

QUICK START:
    Generate physical exam questions with patient demographics:

    >>> from medical_physical_exams_questions import ExamQuestionGenerator
    >>> generator = ExamQuestionGenerator()
    >>> result = generator.generate("Cardiovascular Exam", age=55, gender="Female")
    >>> print(result.exam_type)
    Cardiovascular Exam
    >>> print(result.age)
    55
    >>> print(result.gender)
    Female

    Or use the CLI:

    $ python medical_physical_exams_questions.py -e "Respiratory Exam" -a 45 -g "Male"
    $ python medical_physical_exams_questions.py -e "Abdominal Exam" -a 8 -g "Female" -o custom_output.json -v

COMMON USES:
    1. Medical education - teaching proper physical exam techniques tailored to patient age/gender
    2. Clinical training - standardizing exam question protocols for diverse patient populations
    3. Patient interviews - structured history and assessment questions appropriate for age/gender
    4. Quality assurance - ensuring comprehensive exam coverage with age/gender considerations
