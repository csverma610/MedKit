# Medical Anatomy Module

## Overview
Explains how the human body is structured and how different body parts work together.

**What it does:** Provides detailed information about body organs, systems, and anatomical structures.
**Why it matters:** Understanding anatomy helps you comprehend how diseases affect the body and why certain treatments work.

---

## Scope
This module covers human anatomical structures, body systems, and physiological functions.

---

## What It Does

When you look up a body part or system, you get:

- **Structure:** What the organ/system looks like and where it is
- **Location:** Where in the body it is found
- **Composition:** What it's made of (tissue types, cells, etc.)
- **Function:** What it does and why it's important
- **How It Works:** Step-by-step explanation of how it functions
- **Related Structures:** How it connects to other body parts
- **Common Problems:** What can go wrong with it
- **Medical Significance:** Why understanding it matters for health

---

## Why It Matters

**Understanding anatomy helps you:**
- Understand why doctors examine certain areas
- Comprehend how diseases affect your body
- Know why certain symptoms occur
- Understand medical terminology
- Make informed health decisions
- Reduce anxiety during medical exams

## How to Use

### Python API
```python
from medkit.medical.medical_anatomy import get_anatomy_info

anatomy = get_anatomy_info("heart")
print(anatomy)

anatomy = get_anatomy_info("pancreas")
print(anatomy)
```

### Command Line
```bash
python cli/cli_medical_anatomy.py heart
python cli/cli_medical_anatomy.py brain --functions
```

## Body Systems Covered

**Cardiovascular System:** Heart, blood vessels, blood circulation

**Respiratory System:** Lungs, airways, breathing mechanics

**Nervous System:** Brain, spinal cord, nerves, how signals travel

**Musculoskeletal System:** Bones, muscles, joints, movement

**Digestive System:** Stomach, intestines, organs, food processing

**Endocrine System:** Glands, hormones, regulation

**Urinary System:** Kidneys, bladder, waste removal

**Integumentary System:** Skin, hair, nails, protection

**Immune System:** White blood cells, lymph nodes, defense

## Example: Understanding Heart Anatomy

You learn:
- **Structure:** Four chambers (two atria, two ventricles), four valves
- **Location:** Left side of chest, protected by ribs
- **Composition:** Cardiac muscle (myocardium), inner lining (endocardium), outer covering (pericardium)
- **Function:** Pumps blood throughout the body
- **How it works:** Chambers contract in sequence, pushing blood out
- **Connections:** Receives blood from veins, sends blood out through arteries
- **Common problems:** Heart attacks, valve disorders, arrhythmias
- **Relevance:** Understanding this helps comprehend heart disease and cardiac tests

## Important Notes

**This is a learning tool,** not a medical examination.

**Anatomy varies between people.** Normal variations occur in organ size, position, and connections.

**See a doctor if:** You have concerns about how your body is functioning or experience symptoms.

**Medical exams are thorough.** What you read about here is simplified; your doctor will evaluate your specific situation.

## When to Use This Module

✓ Want to understand how your body works
✓ Doctor mentioned an organ and you want to learn about it
✓ Curious about medical imaging you received
✓ Understanding symptoms related to an organ system
✓ Preparing for surgery or medical procedure

✗ Don't use this to self-diagnose problems
✗ Don't assume your anatomy matches descriptions exactly
✗ Don't ignore symptoms while learning anatomy
✗ Don't replace doctor examination with this information

---

## Limitations

**Simplified explanations:** Real anatomy is more complex than descriptions here.

**Variation:** Every person's anatomy varies slightly from standard descriptions.

**Not diagnostic:** Learning anatomy doesn't diagnose diseases.

**Visual learning:** Anatomy is best learned with actual images/diagrams (not in this text tool).

---

## Disclaimer

**Educational Information Only:** This helps you understand human body structure and function.

**Not Medical Advice:** This is not professional medical evaluation or diagnosis.

**Anatomy Varies:** Your anatomy may differ from standard descriptions.

**See a Doctor:** If you have health concerns, consult a qualified healthcare provider.

**Images Help:** Consider looking at medical images or videos to better understand anatomy alongside this text.
